## What is a regionalism?
There is no hard definition, but I use this one for the purposes of this project:

"a word or phrase that is used or found only in a particular part of Melbourne" (adopted from [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/regionalism).

## List of regionalisms in Melbourne

| Regionalism | Definition | Suburb(s) |
|:--------|:-------:|--------:|
| Broady  | Broadmeadows | Broadmeadows |
| Rezza  | Reservoir | Preston, Reservoir, Thomstown, Lalor |
| Ringers  | Ringwood | Ringwood, Ringwood East |
| Shoppo  | Doncaster Shopping Centre | Balwyn North, Doncaster, Doncaster East, Templestowe |
